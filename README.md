# Fetch-Challenge
## Home Screen
When you run the app, you will find yourself on the main screen that displays all the desserts from the dessert API that was given. You can use
the search bar on this screen to look up desserts by their name. I do this by checking if what the user typed is a substring of the dessert name. If you tap on
one of the dessert cards, you will be directed to the meal detail screen of that specific dessert.

## Meal Detail Screen
On the meal detail screen, you will find the image of the dessert with the name of it as an overlay, the ingredients/measurements in a table view format, and
the instructions for the dessert.
